## The purpose of this project

I used to track my financials in an excel spreadsheet which workd very well for a while but after a few years it become slow and kind of ugly.
I tried using apps that were supposed to do the same as my spreadsheet but none of the worked the way i needed them so I decided to create my own that suits my needs.
